# Advanced SQL Data Analysis

This project showcases my ability to write and apply complex SQL queries for real-world data analysis using MySQL.

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Practice and apply:
  - Subqueries
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  - Window Functions like `RANK()` and `LEAD()`
- Analyze sales data to identify patterns and performance trends.

## 🗃️ Dataset

A sample `sales` table was created with fields like:
- `product_name`
- `category`
- `sale_amount`
- `sale_date`

## 📌 SQL Concepts Used

1. **Subquery** – Filtered products above average sale amount.
2. **CTE (Common Table Expression)** – Calculated average sale by category.
3. **RANK()** – Ranked products within each category.
4. **LEAD()** – Compared current sale with the next product in category.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE
- SQL Language

## 📁 Files Included

- Advanced-SQL-Data-Analysis.sql


## 📈 Learning Outcome

This project helped me gain deeper understanding of SQL used in real-world data analysis, especially for working with grouped and sequential data.
